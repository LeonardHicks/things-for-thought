What would I like to Learn?

1-> Id like learn how to use Modern Tools. 
    > partial knowledge on past and current tools ('non automated') (the use/knowledge is necessary but not always beneficial,
      can be outdated)
    > Automation (use of modern tools to save time, to be able to spend time on the things that i would like to.)
      > CAD,Coding,Production Thinking 
      > An example of the type of approach id like to learn is seen in Frank Penders stainless steel stools,
        https://www.instagram.com/p/CJrVzCXlupR/?img_index=1. 
        The stools are predominently made by by machine, CAD and Lasercutting, which is highly efficient (among other things). 
        Yet what really makes the object is the relationship between the machine process and 
        the human touch which creates the 3Dimensional product.

 > Id like to look into how I could use modern tools to improve my production techinques and grow my creative process. 
   As in history tools and humans have always had a profound relationship, 
   the use of tools always leaves its imprint on the objects we create.
   Such as the stone axe, or pottery created on the spinning wheel, 
   even in the Industrial Revolution when steam engines where created. 

2.-> However I am wary of current modern tools.
     > In a bit of a cliched question, what is the point of balance between humans using tools and tools using humans. 
        > My current thoughts are not concrete enough that i can write them out :P 
          But something along AI creating a shallow and simple human...if were not careful. 
     > A short film on netflix under the title Love, Death and Robots- Zima Blue, is defintely an influential thought on my wariness.

3.-> I really want to work in the ceramic workshop this semester, or anything else but the woodworkshop. 

4.-> Ceramics might fit very well into this project, for it being a production method since the dawn of humanity 
     and still accompanying us in many new forms.
